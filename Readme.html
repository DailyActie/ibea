<h1>Implementation of the IBEA-epsilon algorithm [1]</h1>

<h2>How to run</h2>

<p>There are two ways to run the optimizer:</p>

<p><code>shell
python2 ibea.py
</code>
<br/>
<code>shell
python2 experiment.py
</code></p>

<p>Note that it is easier to change the experiment parameters in the <code>IBEA.py</code> file, by parameterizing the call to <code>experiment.main</code>.</p>

<h2>Convention: Separate parameters</h2>

<p>The idea is to keep the parameters we are testing local.
The best way is to keep the solver definition in <code>experiment.py</code> as: <br/></p>

<p><code>python
SOLVER = IBEA().ibea # line 254
</code> </p>

<p>You may change the parameters when initializing the object, however when you commit some changes, please do:</p>

<p><code>shell
git add -p experiment.py
</code></p>

<p>so as not to write your params on git (and risk overwriting our own when we merge).</p>

<h2>Convention: Shared experimental results</h2>

<p>The idea is that the local sub-directory in which results are saved, namely <code>exdata</code>, is git ignored so that everyone can local experiments.</p>

<p>If you have nice results to share, you may copy the raw or preprocessed results in the toplevel <code>shared_exdata</code> directory and push!</p>
