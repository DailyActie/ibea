\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The objective of this project was to study, implement and benchmark the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm \cite{zitzler2004indicator}\\ (IBEA) using  the Comparing Continuous Optimizer (COCO) platform. Firstly we provide a brief overview of the algorithm. Secondly, we describe our implementation and experimental setup. Finally, we discuss the obtained results and compare them to both baseline approaches and related work.
\end{abstract}

\section{Setting}
In the context of a multi-objective optimization, the main goal is to find a good approximation of the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.
An evolutionary algorithm is an exploration strategy of the domain space $\mathbb{R}^n$ which seeks optimal solution vectors defined in the objective space $\mathbb{R}^k$ (here $k=2$) by promoting at each generation the fittest and/or the  newest individuals from a population of decision vectors.

The performance measure used by IBEA for determining the relative quality of two solution sets in the objective space is a binary indicator function $I: \Omega \times \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 
In terms of two decision vectors $\bm{x}^1$ and $\bm{x}^2$,  the domination relation is defined as : $\bm{x}^1 \succ \bm{x}^2 \leftrightarrow ( f_i(\bm{x}^1) \leq f_i(\bm{x}^2) \; \forall i \in \{1, ..., k\} \;\text{and}\; f_j(\bm{x}^1) < f_j(\bm{x}^2)$ for at least one objective$)$. 
The epsilon indicator, which is compliant with this domination relationship, is defined for pairwise comparisons as: $$I_{\epsilon^+} (\{\bm{x}^1\}, \{\bm{x}^2\}) = \min_\epsilon f_i(\bm{x}^1) - \epsilon \leq f_i(\bm{x}^2) \; \forall i \in \{1, ..., k\}$$. 
Its focus is to summarize the minimum distance needed to improve on the Pareto set approximation to a single scalar. 
Intuitively, the reduction to a single scalar may incur a  loss of information regarding some dimensions of objective space. Indeed, the fact that the indicator chooses the minimum improvement across all objectives implies \emph{conservative} rather than more \emph{optimistic} updates of the fitness estimate. Clearly, we may miss out on potential improvement on some of the targeted objectives. The fitness value is defined in the sequel as a measure of the usefulness of each individual with regards to the optimization goal. As such, the algorithm tries to maximize it.
$$ F(\bm{x}^1) = \sum_{\bm{x}^2 \in P \setminus \{\bm{x}^1\}} - \exp{\frac{I(\{\bm{x}^1\}, \{\bm{x}^2\})}{\kappa}}$$ where $P$ is the population set, and $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. The fitness function of an approximation set is defined as a \emph{dominance preserving relation}.

Moreover, as the optimization functions are typically unnormalized, IBEA scales both the values taken by the objective function as well as the values taken by the indicator function. Consequently the need for parameter tuning in face of problem and indicator function diversity is decreased.

\section{Implementation}
The input of the algorithm is the size of the population ($\alpha$), a maximum number of generations, a budget in function evaluations, and a fitness scaling factor ($\kappa$). The output of the algorithm is an approximation of the Pareto-set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization:} generate an initial population P of given size uniformly between the lower and upper bound of the domain space.

\item \textbf{Fitness assignment:} compute and assign a fitness value to each individual in P.

\item \textbf{Environmental selection:} detect and remove individuals which have the smallest fitness values from the population until the current size of the population P does not exceed $\alpha$. Update the fitness values for all remaining individuals.

\item \textbf{Termination:} after the environmental selection is performed, the termination criterion of the algorithm is checked; if the maximum number of generations is reached or another termination criterion is met, the algorithm returns the set of decision vectors A.

\item \textbf{Mating Selection:} consists in creating as temporary mating pool P' which is filled with individuals from P by performing binary tournament selection with replacement on P.

\item \textbf{Variation:} finally the variation step consists applying recombination and mutation operators to the previously created mating pool.  
The offspring resulting from variation is added to P and the generation counter is incremented. The algorithm is then performed again from step 2, until a termination criterion is met.

\end{enumerate}

Population-related data (i.e decision vectors, objective and fitness values) is stored in a hash table for timely access. 
All numerical computation is done with NumPy. 
The optimizer is an object which incurs some overhead in Python. Except for the recombination and mutation operators which were implemented in separate functions to achieve modularity during testing, the optimizer is essentially a single inlined function.

\subsection{Recombination}

At first, the crossover operators we experimented with were intermediate weighting and discrete recombination. Then we implemented the Simulated Binary Crossover \cite{deb1994simulated},\cite{beyer2001self}. The results reported here used SBX-5 for recombination.

\subsection{Variation}

For the mutation step, we began by simply adding isotropic Gaussian noise with fixed variance to the produced offspring. 
It is well known that fixed variance results in a rather slow search for target vectors. 
For that reason we implemented derandomized step-size adaptation (Algorithm 2, \cite{hansen2015evolution}).


\subsection*{Budget pitfall} Before the intermediate report we used an irrelevant budget value. Thus the start of benchmarking was delayed.

\section{Experimental setup}
Our idea was to evaluate the influence of hyper-parameters on the performance achieved for different function groups and in different number of dimensions. For a reasonably low budget ($10^3$) and $10^6$ to $10^9$ number of runs, we tried the following ranges for hyper-parameters (best values in bold):
\begin{itemize}
\item Population size $\in \{50, 80, \bm{100}, 150, 200\}$
\item Number of offspring $\in \{20, 30, 35, 40, \bm{50}\}$
\item Mutation probability: \textbf{low (0.1)}, high (>0.7)
\item Crossover probability $\in {[0.5, 1.0]}$ (best was $\bm{0.7}$)
\item Initial mutation step-size $\in \{1.0, 2.5, \bm{5.0}, 10, 15\}$
\item Distribution index of the SBX operator: 2 and 5
\end{itemize}

Our focus was mostly on crossover and mutation probabilities, as well as population and offspring size. Naturally, the total runtime of an experiment depends on the size of the population, the dimension of the problem and the budget. Carrying out experiments with all their combinations would be time consuming. As such, we set for a grid search approach: we fixed all parameters except one to reasonable defaults and tuned the last one by picking values from a range of interest and comparing the output of the test suite.

\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \algname with restarts on the entire bbob-biobj test suite \cite{biobj2016func}. The Python code was run on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU. For a population size of 100, the time per function evaluation for $10D$ is $2.2ms$ and $6.5ms$ for isotropic and derandomized step-size adaptation mutation respectively.  


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results of \algname\ from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and \cite{brockhoff2016biobjective} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{biobj2016func} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:ECDFsingleOne}, \ref{fig:ECDFsingleTwo}. The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2016cocoplat}, version 15.4.
We present here comparative ECDFs on $2D$ and $5D$ with Random Search and NSGA-II \cite{deb2002fast} as baselines. The comparison is also done with the implementation of IBEA-$\epsilon$ in C and the implementation of IBEA with Hypervolume indicator in Python.

\subsection*{Remark}
In the aRT tables, IBEA corresponds to the following order: IBEA-$\epsilon$ in C, IBEA-$\epsilon$ in Python and IBEA-HV in Python (the last one is absent in $5D$)

\subsection{Observations}

In low dimension, we notice that the instances in which our algorithm performs moderately well is the \textbf{separable}, \textbf{moderate} and \textbf{weakly-structured} case. Examples of this are the separable Ellipsoid (Attractive Sector and Rosenbrock). It fails however in the face of multimodal and ill-conditioned functions.

Clearly, derandomized step-size adaptation performs better than isotropic mutation. Unsurprisingly, the algorithm reached a runtime of $1e{-3}$ iff the variance is adapted. Moreover, extreme values of variance for the isotropic mutation negatively impact the performance of the algorithm.

In higher dimensions, the trends are the same. The supplementary degrees of freedom clearly decreases the number of targets reached.

The fact that our implementation is inferior to random search, independently of problem conditioning, indicates that our evolution strategy either converges to local optima too often, or does not preserve diversity well enough (and that could be a reason why uniform search beats it given high enough budget).

\subsection{Related Work}
To some extent the comparison of the results achieved with those of the group studing IBEA-HV is quite revealing. 
Our intuition that the $\epsilon$ indicator may be overly simplistic for the wide range of optimization functions benchmarked is in some sense confirmed. Observing the impact of the indicator function on the aRT, overall IBEA-HV not only finds better targets more often, but it also finds them in much fewer evaluations (at least for the $2D$ results given).

\section*{Conclusion}
For the implementation and benchmarking of a scientifically approved evolution strategy, we were confronted throughtout this project with the scientific process in multi-objective black-box optimization algorithms. We had to autonomously develop and test diverse evolutionary approaches, and furthermore reason about their respective pertinence and effectiveness. Going forward, we could think of indicator functions that may be  well-suited for a wide diversity of optimization problems. Of equal importance, we could think of step-size adaptation schemes (e.g CMA) to improve convergence to the global optimum.
