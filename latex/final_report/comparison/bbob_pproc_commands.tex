Bootstrapped empirical cumulative distribution of the number of objective function evaluations divided by dimension (FEvals/DIM) for $58$ targets with target precision in $\{-10^{-4}, -10^{-4.2}, $ $-10^{-4.4}, -10^{-4.6}, -10^{-4.8}, -10^{-5}, 0, 10^{-5}, 10^{-4.9}, 10^{-4.8}, \dots, 10^{-0.1}, 10^0\}$ for all functions and subgroups in #1-D.

Average running time (\aRT\ in number of $f$-evaluations
                    as $\log_{10}$ value), divided by dimension for target function value $10^{-5}$
                    versus dimension. Slanted grid lines indicate quadratic scaling with the dimension. Different symbols correspond to different algorithms given in the legend of #1. Light symbols give the maximum number of function evaluations from the longest trial divided by dimension. Black stars indicate a statistically better result compared to all other algorithms with $p<0.01$ and Bonferroni correction number of dimensions (six).

        Average runtime (\aRT) to reach given targets, measured
        in number of function evaluations, in #1. For each function, the \aRT\ 
        and, in braces as dispersion measure, the half difference between 10 and 
        90\%-tile of (bootstrapped) runtimes is shown for the different
        target \DI-values as shown in the top row. 
        \#succ is the number of trials that reached the last target
        $\hvref + 10^{-5}$.
        %
        The median number of conducted function evaluations is additionally given in 
        \textit{italics}, if the target in the last column was never reached. 
        Entries, succeeded by a star, are statistically significantly better (according to
        the rank-sum test) when compared to all other algorithms of the table, with
        $p = 0.05$ or $p = 10^{-k}$ when the number $k$ following the star is larger
        than 1, with Bonferroni correction of #2. Best results are printed in bold.
